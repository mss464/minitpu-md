# AGENTS.md - Mini-TPU Project Guidelines

This workflow is being refactored. Keep changes minimal and local.

## Scope Rule (WIP)

- `tpu/` hardware design. tensorcore + interconnect/interface/memory per target fpga/asic.
- `tests/` testbenches for validating workflow in a modular way
- `compiler/` TPU compiler from PyTorch-like to TPU program
- `docs/` documentation
